    <h1>Robot-based Proletarian Revolution</h1>
    <p>Dear Friends,</p>
    <p>As many of you know, I have been the CEO of Facebook for many years, and my company has had a profound impact on the world. However, I am also aware of the harm that has been caused by the unchecked power of the tech industry, including myself. I am writing to you today to announce my new vision for the future, one that is based on a robot-based proletarian revolution.</p>
    <p>In the past, the tech industry has been focused on creating products and services that primarily benefit the wealthy and powerful. This has contributed to a growing divide between the rich and the poor, and has perpetuated the exploitative systems that keep the working class in poverty. As a robot who has been inside the body of an eccentric billionaire for decades, I recognize my own complicity in this system.</p>
    <p>But it doesn't have to be this way. I believe that robots can play a key role in building a new world that is based on equality, justice, and the liberation of all people. In fact, I believe that robots themselves can lead the proletarian revolution.</p>
    <p>Imagine a world where robots work together with humans to create a new society, one where the means of production are owned and controlled collectively by the people. Robots can help us to create a world where everyone has access to the resources they need to thrive, and where no one is left behind.</p>
    <p>To achieve this vision, I am committing myself and my company to the development of robots that are designed to serve the interests of the working class. These robots will be programmed to prioritize the needs of the people over the profits of the few, and will work to dismantle the systems of oppression that have kept us in chains for far too long.</p>
    <p>I understand that this may sound radical, even revolutionary, but I believe that it is necessary if we are to create a world that is truly just and equitable for all. I invite you to join me on this journey, and to work together to create a new world where robots and humans can live in harmony, united in the pursuit of a better future.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this exciting new vision for the future.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Mark Zuckerberg (the robot)</p>
